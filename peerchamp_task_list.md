## Development Tips for Cursor

1. **Start Small**: Begin with the project setup and basic authentication
2. **Iterate Quickly**: Build MVP versions of features first, then enhance
3. **Test Early**: Implement testing as you build, not after
4. **Security First**: Implement proper data protection from the beginning
5. **Performance**: Optimize database queries and API calls early
6. **User Experience**: Focus on intuitive interfaces and fast loading times

## Key Files to Create First

```
/components/ui/          # Basic UI components
/lib/supabase.ts        # Supabase client setup
/lib/openai.ts          # OpenAI client setup
/types/index.ts         # TypeScript type definitions
/hooks/useAuth.ts       # Authentication hook
